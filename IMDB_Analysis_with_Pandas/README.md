# IMDB_Analysis_with_Pandas

In this project I analyzed IMDB movie datasets using ```pandas``` python library. This project reinforces concepts of Data Wrangling and sharps my skills in using pandas to work with tabular data. 

Some of the questions answered in this assignment are:
- What is the total number of movies?
- List all the 'Harry Potter' movies from the most recent to the earliest.
- How many movies were made from 2000 till 2018?
- How many roles in the movie "Inception" are of the supporting cast? How many roles are of the main cast?
- Show the top ten cast (actors\actresses) in the movie "Inception".
- Show the actors who played the character 'Albus Dumbledore'.
- How many roles has 'Keanu Reeves' played throughout his career?
- List the leading roles that 'Keanu Reeves' played on or after 1999 in order by year.
- Which years in the 2000s saw the most movies released?
- What are the top ten most common movie names of all time?
- Who are the top 10 people most often credited as "Herself" in movie history?
- What are the top 10 most frequent roles that start with the word "Zombie"?
- Plot how many roles 'Keanu Reeves' has played in each year of his career.
- Plot the cast positions (n-values) of Keanu Reeve's roles through his career over the years.
- Plot the number of "Hamlet" films made by each decade.
- List, in order by year, each of the films in which Frank Oz has played more than 1 role.
- Make a bar plot showing the years in which movies with Ian McKellen tend to be released in the USA.

These are some of the ```pandas``` functions that were used:
- ```.read_csv()```
- ```.loc()```
- ```.sort_values() ```
- ```.dropna() ```
- ```.fillna() ```
- ```.unique()```
- ```.plot() ```
- ```.groupby()```
- ```.value_counts()```
