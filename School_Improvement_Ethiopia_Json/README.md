# Data Wrangling and Normalized Dataframes from Nested Json Strings

In this assigment I read a json file containing real-life data from World Bank. This dataset is from a school quality improvement project in Ethiopia. I used ```pandas``` and ```json_normalize``` to normalize dataframes from nested json strings. I read the json file as a string and as a table to find answers to the following questions:

1. What are the 10 countries with most projects?
2. What are the top 10 major project themes?
3. Fill in missing values where possible.
