# ML-Bootcamp-Projects
This repository contains projects that I have worked on during my Springboard AI / Machine Learning Bootcamp.

In the [Qunadl_API_calls](https://github.com/diana-md/ML-Bootcamp-Projects/tree/master/Qunadl_API_calls) project I gathered financial data by using ```requests``` and ```json``` Python libraries to make API calls to Qunadl, which is the most widely used aggregator of financial market data. I analyzed and manipulated the dataset using lists and Python dictionaries.
